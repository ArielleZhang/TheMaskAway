### Synthesized Masked Data ###
This dir contains teh original dataset found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varump66/face-images-13233, and three synthesized datasets with N95, black inpaint, and plain inpaint. Every person has multiple photos but with roughly same posture and angle.

All photos are resized to 256 by 256, the ratio is changed a bit but I dont think it will affect the overall quality, ```/lanczos``` contains the better quality photos, ```/resized``` contains the meh ones, but the photos in these two dirs are the same.

Remember to unzip when you download to local cuz files are too large it I dont zip.
